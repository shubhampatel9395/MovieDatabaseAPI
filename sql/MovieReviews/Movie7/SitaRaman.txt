    "reviewTitle": "Best movie of DS.",
    "reviewContent": "I can only tell that the hatred this movie is getting is not by the ones who watched the movie but ones who didn't even watch it. They just comment on what ever they want to tell just because they hate DS or director or rashmika idk. But actually this movie is a masterpiece and deserves to be a masterpiece with lots and lots of positive talks. I'm kannadiga and this is my first non Kannada movie review. Since I loved this movie with my whole heart.\n \n If you are thinking of going to this movie by analyzing these comments then you should definitely ignore the hatred ones."
