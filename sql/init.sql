The first few minutes of the film might be a little strange and frustrating even, where it plays out like an advertisement for modern love moving at a breakneck pace of a whirlwind romance. Jai and Meera meet, fall madly in love, spend incredible moments together, only to allow reasons of practicality spoil everything. Since their careers are going to put them thousands of miles apart – Meera heading towards Delhi and Jai dreaming of eventually relocating to San Francisco, having no trust in long distance relationship means the logical decision to break up and remain friends.\n \n In the other story, Veer Singh (Saif Ali Khan again) meets and falls in love with Harleen Kaur (newcomer Gisele), but being the old-fashioned Romeo and with a process in place to woo the woman of your dreams, he finds it extremely difficult to break the ice, and only to learn that his task has been made doubly complex with the dimension of distance getting in the way as Harleen\'s family uproots to Kolkata. Swearing a pledge that he will marry her, and for all lifetimes, he journeys to the other side of India, happy to just catch a glimpse of his lady love. And so begins a very tough courtship of stolen glances and secret rendezvous against stacked up odds of opposition.\n \n As a romance, this film has plenty put on its plate. A good looking and charismatic cast, beautiful landscapes and visuals thanks to the jetsetting nature of the story from London to Delhi to Kolkata to San Francisco, and a number of fantastic lines of dialogue sprinkled with a reasonable dose of comedy, and touching moments too. What\'s there not to like and make you fall in love with the characters, and wring your hand at their predicament, most of which were self-inflicted? Its two stories tell the stark difference between the modern rules of courtship based on practicality, versus that of the more traditional way, though the common thread will always, and has been to follow your heart. The thrill of the chase for instant gratification looks flimsy when set against the old fashioned notion of earning and justifying one\'s sincerity through action, rather than cheap talk which Saif Ali Khan\'s Jai is expert at.\n \n The song and dance numbers are OK, though personally nothing was memorable enough to have stuck in my head way after the end credits start rolling. There were fun numbers of course where both leads in their modern roles seem to relish in, highlighting their personal, playful nature as they paint the town red in their secret rendezvous without the knowledge of their newfound partners. I thought there would be enough moments for each to showcase the pain of their ill-informed decisions of breaking up, but all we got was from the guy\'s point of view, and that was very much after the fact, which I felt time would probably start to heal all wounds, unless of course you let little personal details of milestones in your ex\'s life to come in and disrupt your current lifestyle.\n \n Though of course in this story\'s love found, love lost and love gained, there were set pieces which tests the characters resolve, especially the one where their crazy game of double dating on the sly with their new partners, Jai\'s Jo (Florence Brudenell-Bruce) and Meera\'s Vikram (Rahul Khanna), rang through some intense pain and uncomfortable jealousy, providing a cliffhanger for the perennial interval.\n \n If there\'s one thing I dislike and one of the themes as expounded in the film, it\'s the lack of honesty in the games people play. The romances of old are seemingly simple enough, without facades put up and masks worn to hide true intentions. Contrasted with today\'s of course, where both Jai and Meera find it too cool to be acknowledging their feelings properly for each other, and go on a round-about journey before they start to realize their true emotions, and face up to them sincerely. Needless to say, between the two stories, I had preferred the older one which is more engaging, honest and wistful even.\n \n All in all, Love Aaj Kal didn\'t manage to hit the heights that its star billing had the potential to, but still came across as a better than average romantic movie that\'s suitable for a date.','A Nutshell Review: Love Aaj Kal',3,4),(8,'User2','2023-06-06 14:25:13.835000','User2','2023-06-06 14:25:13.835000',1,10.00,'It was very fresh kind of film at that time.

Sure they tried and tried hard to make this movie more spectacular than all the others but one can only shut off their brain for so long. Pushing the boundaries of cinema is one thing but when you throw all sense and reality out the window you get, well this. In the first 5 minutes of the movie I already could tell this was going straight to the Moon with zero plan of how to actually get there. You see Dominic\'s 8 year old son driving and drifting a muscle car around a parking lot as if he was a pro. Utter ridiculous crap. What\'s next, to the actual Moon? Or maybe there is a secret bunker in the center of the Earth the team has to infiltrate in order to save the world? Or maybe Dom\'s car gets a time machine installed in it and they travel back in time to fight Hitler and the SS? I mean, why not? Everything else that happens in this movie is just as plausible. Everyone in Dom\'s team is an expert at everything and they all seem to be super-human as well.

I think some people went to space.\n \n The F&F series is one where villains become friends, people come back from the dead and cars defy the laws of physics. No one has an idea of the story soon after they watched it.\n \n A plot inspired by Fast 5, where they stole a safe and rode it along the streets of Rio de Janeiro.\n \n Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) is the sociopathic son of Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and he wants to make Dom Toretto and his family suffer for what happened to his dad.\n \n The main action starts by dropping a big rolling bomb in Rome and aim it for the Vatican.\n \n Plagued with behind the scenes issues. Original director Justin Lin departed soon after shooting started. Director Louis Leterrier does a workmanlike job. As he showed in the Netflix series Lupin, Now You See Me as well as The Transporter movies. He can do car stunts as well as sleight of hand. Some of the CGI looked cheap though.\n \n As for Momoa, the director obviously told him. Man you will never play the Joker, too Polynesian. So Dante is your Joker and dial it up to 12. He is loud, camp and is having a ball. Especially with those two IT guys with a funny grin on their faces.\n \n Some of the regulars are even more tiresome. A few should had showed up but did not like those two Brazilian guys from the earlier movies. John Cena plays lovable Uncle Jacob, he was the main villain in the last one.\n \n The movie actually has four Oscar winning actresses. Not one of them told Vin Diesel how to do dramatic. When Dom had these small tender scenes, I nearly fell asleep.','Fast X',4,3),(12,'User3','2023-06-06 14:35:33.720000','User3','2023-06-06 14:35:33.720000',1,8.00,'Admittedly I hadn\'t seen of these \'Fast\' movies in a long time, but I\'m not crazy am I - the cast wasn\'t always this strong, was it? There is a truly insane lineup of stars in this movie, and somehow the movie finds a way to give every one of them a purpose.\n \n Jason Momoa as the bad guy is worth mentioning as being terrific. He looked like he had a lot of fun with the role. It seemed like he was given a lot of leeway to do as he pleased and he used it wisely. He actually gave me a lot of \'Joker\' vibes.\n \n The film is long at 2 hours and 21 minutes, but it\'s a rare time when I felt the film could absolutely justify it. For one thing the pacing is incredible and time really does fly by. For another thing there is so much going on and so many cast members who need time to do their thing that it was absolutely necessary. Actually the fact they were able to cut the run time down to only this was an accomplishment.\n \n The action scenes and the story are as outrageous as we have come to expect from this series. It\'s at the point now where you simply have to sit back, switch your mind off and enjoy the ride. And to be honest it\'s pretty easy to do with this film.

There aren\'t too many companies who have reached the pinnacle of their industry, only to later flop due to lack of innovation or a stubborn insistence on holding on to the past. Tremendous success and absolute failure are not typically associated with the same company. Blockbuster Video and Pan Am Airlines come to mind as examples of industry leaders whose refusal to adapt, culminated with closure, and it\'s likely that Blackberry belongs in the category, at least as presented here by writer-director Matt Johnson and co-writer Matthew Miller, adapting the book by Jacquie McNish.\n \n Socially awkward pals, Mike Lazaridis (played by Jay Baruchel) and Doug Fregin (played by the film\'s director Matt Johnson), co-founded Research in Motion (RIM). The film picks up in 1996 when Mike and Doug are making their first presentation of their breakthrough handheld data delivery-email machine, which they have named Pocket Link. These are two genius nerds with no concept of how the outside business worlds functions, and the executive to whom they are pitching is so distracted that his only feedback is, \"You need a new name.\" In a fascinating twist, that same executive, Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton, \"It\'s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\") ends up saving not just the new product, but also the company.\n \n Balsillie presents himself as a fireball, take charge, full-steam-ahead kind of guy. It\'s quite a contrast to nerdy Mike and easy-going Doug. Mike is a quiet guy committed to perfection in his work, while Doug wrangles the tech developers with a culture of video games, movie night, and an overall fraternity environment. Balsillie\'s arrival as a vocal outrage expert and brash businessman changes everything, and he and Mike drive the newly named BlackBerry to levels not previously seen. We do get a humorous anecdote from a shirt stain (even though it\'s not a true story), and in fact, there is quite a bit of humor throughout.\n \n We are informed that the film was \"inspired by real people and real events\", so some dramatic license is expected. Perhaps the best comparison is THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010), and while that film was more polished, I personally found this one more entertaining and accurate from a business sense. An excellent supporting cast includes Cary Elwes, Saul Rubinek, Michael Ironside, Martin Donovan, Rich Sommer, and SungWon Cho, and the film\'s real draw is the contrast between Jay Baruchel\'s mousy but brilliant Mike, and Glenn Howard\'s powerhouse portrayal of the egotistical Balsillie. Baruchel\'s scene where he reacts to the new iPhone is alone worth the price of admission.\n \n At its peak, BlackBerry had 45% market share and had earned it\'s \"CrackBerry\" label in the business world. Apple\'s 2007 introduction of the iPhone not only rocked the BlackBerry company, it shook up the world. The Canada perspective is noted (RIM was based in Waterloo, Ontario), as is Mike\'s aversion to \'made in China\', perhaps the ultimate reason for the fall. It\'s likely that BlackBerry has become a Case Study in Business Schools, although the fast-paced and pressure-packed world of tech continues to require a balance of decisions focused on current markets and never-ending innovation for the future.','rise and fall of crackberry',6,2),(16,'User2','2023-06-06 15:11:33.779000','User2','2023-06-06 15:11:33.779000',1,7.00,'There\'s a rather angry man by name of Jim, expecting others to dance to, his latest whim, can get quite shouty if confronted, he\'ll ensure you are affronted, has a fury that can\'t be contained by rim. But he\'s managed to create a new black gold, taking gullible and naïve to a mould, casting out a new tech giant, though it\'s not quite all compliant, the board of keys has broken ground, and taken hold. Alas like all technology there is a trend, and in this case it\'s closely linked to a u-bend, as the stock goes down the pan, the innovation had no plan, to evolve and to compete, as Jobs transcends.\n \n It\'s worth a watch, and may get you thinking of all those brands of the past that now reside in the graveyard of complacent, missed opportunity.','The Grape of Wrath...',6,3),(17,'User3','2023-06-06 15:12:33.328000','User3','2023-06-06 15:12:33.328000',1,10.00,'Films about the making of a product can either be interesting or dull. In my opinion, there\'s not a lot of room in between because it was either a good story or not. In the case of Blackberry, I was obviously aware of the phone but never knew the behind-the-scenes stuff. I\'m also slightly biased being a Canadian, with this film taking place very close to where I\'m from, so if that makes you take this review with a grain of salt, so be it. I absolutely loved it from start to finish and here\'s why.\n \n Blackberry tells the story of Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel) and his genius mind that creates the world\'s first smartphone, the Blackberry.\n \n Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton) steps in and buys his way into being the Co-CEO of the company in order to sell the phone. Balsillie is determined to shoot for the moon and nothing else, which in turn may or may not hurt the company overall. If you know the story, you know what I mean, but I won\'t ruin it. My favourite thing about watching this film though was the fact that I didn\'t know half of what went down in real life. This was a riveting and engaging lesson of school that I felt like a sat through.\n \n Adapted from the novel by Matthew Miller and Matt Johnson (who also did a fantastic job directing this film), the dialogue here was stellar. I was glued to the screen, even when two characters were just sitting in a room and talking. I\'m not saying this film is as great as The Social Network, but the story itself is in my opinion. It\'s a fascinating tale of the dog-eat-dog world that we live in. On top of the fantastic dialogue, Baruchel and Howerton sell these roles and probably each delivers the performances of their careers (especially Howerton).\n \n From the editing style that genuinely impressed me to the great direction, performances, and even music choices, Blackberry is a film that I have little to no complaints about. The camera work with all the snap zooms annoyed me a bit, but that\'s really all I can nitpick. I also give it props for being a Canadian film, made by Canadians, starring some Canadian actors. I would also be remiss if I didn\'t mention the fact that while the story is very interesting, it\'s also funny when it needs to be. It almost becomes a satire at times and I loved it even more for that. It took the story seriously, but not exactly the movie around it, which worked so well. If you can\'t tell, I\'ll be gushing about this one for a while. I highly recommend checking out Blackberry, now playing in theatres.','One Hell of a Story',6,4),(18,'User3','2023-06-06 15:18:55.914000','User3','2023-06-06 15:18:55.914000',1,10.00,'I can only tell that the hatred this movie is getting is not by the ones who watched the movie but ones who didn\'t even watch it.

Luckily, the human characters don\'t interfere too much with the animals, and still bring a certain charm to the screen. Stuart is wonderfully voiced by Michael J.Fox, and he joined by a hilarious Nathan Lane as Snowbell and a villainous Chazz Palminteri as Smoky.
